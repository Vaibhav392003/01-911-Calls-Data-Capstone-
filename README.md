# 01-911-Calls-Data-Capstone-


In my capstone project, I delved into the fascinating world of US police calls data, using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to explore patterns and trends. With the help of Seaborn, I crafted compelling visualizations that brought the data to life, from geographic heatmaps of call frequency to insightful bar charts revealing peak times for emergencies. To add a touch of interactivity, I embraced Cafflinks and Plotly, allowing users to dynamically explore the data and uncover hidden insights by filtering by time, location, or call type. This project was a thrilling journey through the power of data analysis, and I'm eager to share my findings and insights with the world!

911 Calls Capstone Project - Analysing the frequency of emergency 911 calls.
This project is developed on a Jupyter notebook using Python with Numpy, Pandas data analysis libraries along with Matplotlib and seaborn data visualization libraries. The dataset is used from Kaggle for data analysis.
This project involves the exploratory data analysis and data visualization of the frequency of 911 emergency calls made throughout the time of the year and also for which common reasons/incidents 911 calls are usually made during which part of the year.
